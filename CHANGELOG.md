# Changelog

The record of shipped work for the Notees Flutter mobile client. One entry
per shipped slice, newest first. This file — not `AGENTS.md`, not `docs/` —
is where history goes; those stay static guidance. Before implementing a
change, skim this file for recent related work. Anything before 2026-10-06
lives in git history.

## 2026-10-06

- **chore(docs): record-keeping aligned with the main repo — plan-era
  citations scrubbed, AGENTS.md aligned, per-client skill pair added.** Same
  treatment the main Notees monorepo gave itself on this date: every §-citation
  token removed from code comments, test titles, and docs (sentence kept, e.g.
  "(owner review 2026-10-05): …"; "WIRE.md §2" → "WIRE.md"); all
  `implementation-plan` / "main repo's plan" references deleted or made
  self-contained; narrative v1/v2 history reworded minimally ("the v2 store"
  → "the TS store", "legacy v1 ops" → "legacy ops", stale `v2/packages/…`
  layout qualifiers dropped to the current monorepo paths); the 18 milestone
  markers (M1–M3 prose labels) removed. Deliberate keeps: the vendored fixture
  corpus stays byte-pinned (fixture comment strings are part of the
  sha256-pinned convergence corpus — untouched, as in the monorepo), live
  version identifiers (`protocol v2`, envelope v3, `/api/relay/v2`, WS framing
  v2, `v2.0.0-mN`-style version tags, local DB schema versions v16–v26, the
  fixture corpus paths, code symbols like `SyncV2Service`), and the
  AGENTS.md release-pipeline docs (v*-tag → versionCode/APK mechanics).
  Comments/docs/test-titles only — no logic, symbol, or assertion changes.
- **chore(repo): legacy "v2" labels out of the fixture corpus — `test/fixtures/v2`
  → `test/fixtures/wire`, `v2_fixtures_test.dart` → `fixtures_test.dart`,
  `v2_fixture_replay_test.dart` → `fixture_replay_test.dart`; the three
  completed plan docs deleted.** Fixture JSON bytes untouched (sha256-verified
  before/after; the corpus stays pinned to the monorepo's
  `packages/protocol/fixtures/`). No test-side symbols carried the label (no
  `V2Fixtures`-style identifiers existed) so no symbol renames; protocol-version
  logic (`protocolVersion` checks, relay protocol v2 semantics) deliberately
  untouched. Every path reference updated (the seven fixture-loading test
  files, the development skill + workflow reference, AGENTS.md records table).
  `git rm docs/plan.md docs/plan-product-alignment.md docs/plan-sync-relay.md` —
  the AGENTS.md docs listing now keeps only `flutter-audit.md` and
  `gap-analysis-web-vs-mobile.md`.
- **chore(docs): AGENTS.md becomes static guidance with a records index.**
  Added the "Records" section (the changelog-is-the-record law + records
  table), the "Project skills" tree, and made the Server Reference
  host-agnostic ("a sibling clone of git@github.com:miquelrosell99/notees.git,
  kept up to date" — no hardcoded sibling path).
- **chore(docs): per-client skill pair created under `.agents/skills/`.**
  `notees-flutter-development` (lockstep law, fixture byte-pin, the
  build/test gate, changelog law, no-legacy-version-names rule; detail in
  `references/development-workflow.md`) and `notees-flutter-operations`
  (v*-tag → release.yml → GitHub Release APK pipeline, versionCode
  derivation, CI artifacts vs release APKs, the never-re-tag law; detail in
  `references/releases.md`).
- **chore(docs): `CHANGELOG.md` created** as this repo's shipped-work record,
  mirroring the main-repo format.
