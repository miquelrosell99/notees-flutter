# AGENTS.md — Notees Mobile

This file contains project-specific context for the first-class Flutter mobile app in `mobile/`.

## Overview

The mobile app is a **first-class native Flutter app** for Notees. It provides native Android and iOS experiences for the workflows users do most often on phones.

- **Package**: `com.notees.notees` (Android)
- **Display name**: `Notees`
- **Functional accent**: sage green `#5B7D5B`
- **Architecture**: feature-first Flutter with Provider + ChangeNotifier, Dio, go_router, sqflite
- **Native features**: biometric app lock, offline quick-capture queue, share receiver, native block editor with inline styles and node/class/tag links, native list/card/table views, bottom navigation, advanced search filters, reusable node picker, native settings with server and account management

## Build

**Prefer CI builds.** The Docker-based local build (`./build-apk.sh`) downloads the Flutter image, the Android SDK/NDK, and compiles Gradle on every run, which is heavy for an i3/16 GB server that runs other apps. Use GitHub Actions instead:

```bash
# Trigger a release APK build and print the run URL
cd mobile
./trigger-ci-build.sh
```

Then grab the artifact from the printed workflow run.

For local emergencies only:

```bash
cd mobile
./build-apk.sh
```

This outputs `dist/notees.apk`.

## Local development with Docker Compose

A `compose.yaml` is provided for lightweight local Flutter checks without installing the Flutter SDK. It uses the same `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/flutter:stable` image as CI and persists `pub-cache` and Gradle caches in Docker volumes.

```bash
cd mobile

# Run static analysis (fast; catches compile errors before a full build)
docker compose run --rm flutter flutter analyze

# Run tests
docker compose run --rm flutter flutter test

# Build a release APK
docker compose run --rm build-apk
```

The Android workflow runs `flutter analyze` first so compile errors fail fast instead of after a full Gradle build.

## Design System

- Monochrome base layer dominates 90%+ of the UI.
- Functional accent (sage `#5B7D5B`) is used only for selected states, badges, primary buttons, and status indicators.
- Cards use `borderRadius: 20`, zero elevation, subtle outline at 10% opacity.
- Bottom sheets use top radius of 28.
- Dynamic color is supported via `dynamic_color` and can be enabled in Settings.

## Security Notes

- Server credentials and tokens are stored in `flutter_secure_storage`.
- Biometric lock is enabled in Settings and gates app resume.
